# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations course.  

The site consists of a main index page with links to a few recipe pages. Each recipe page includes a title, an image, a description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Setting up and structuring an HTML project
- Using basic HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links)
- Practicing relative links between pages
- Working with Git and GitHub (cloning, committing, pushing, repository management)

## Reflection (to update after completion)
Completing this project helped me reinforce the basics of HTML and gave me more confidence in using Git for version control. I also practiced maintaining a clean project structure and writing documentation (this README).
